# Changelog (selected)
## 2026-01
- Recipe-aware backend artifacts and dataset helpers (per-recipe persistence + default fallback).
- Reserved recipe id `last` rejected by backend (HTTP 400); GUI avoids sending it.
- Type-safety cleanup to reduce Pylance errors; safer feature/token extraction and concurrency locks.
- GUI batch inspection controls repositioned for better visibility.
